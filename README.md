# tumblr_digest
sends you the last day's worth of tumblr posts, so Rita will stop obsessively checking tumblr

## instructions
uhh this isn't really for other people to use, but make a config yml (sign up for sendgrid and the tumblr api) and make a blacklist.txt (follow those examples)

```gem install bundler
bundle install
ruby tumblr_digest.rb
```

## FAQ

*Why not RSS?*
ugh it's so annoying to filter through all these doctor who posts, and whenever I unfollow or follow somebody the RSS feeds need to be updated separately

*Why not IFTTT?*
man if you've ever tried to get your dash on IFTTT you'll know that it doesn't include the body of the posts, defying the whole point of the exercise

*This doesn't seem like it would stop you from going on Tumblr.*
look i'm trying here

*This also isn't very object-oriented.*
lay off me i whipped it up quickly

*Why are you a jerk to yourself in your own FAQs?*
man idk
